# Assembly_x86_64

Basic assembly programs. Because of its simplicity, a code in assembly is easier to compile and execute compared to codes written in other higher programming languages.
Alongside URM, assembly is essential if you want to understand how the core operations (such as multiplying) work. Try not to end up with a spaghetti code though.. :)
